                    <h2>About </h2>
					
					<p class="lead">Feminism in Theory and Action is a day of talks and workshops aiming to bring together different feminist conversations. Our organisers are all active in various areas and have organised talks and workshops that reflect the multifaceted, consciously intersectional face of feminism today. We are keen to bridge the gap between student feminism and the daily struggles of women outside of universities.
					</p>
							
					<p class="lead">Feminism in Theory and Action is intentionally political - we want to host a day of talks that focuses on what can be done to further feminist goals and to engage with everyday feminist struggles. The day will include panel discussions, workshops, documentary screenings, reading groups and more - there will even be an installation of feminist art!
					</p>
					
					<p class="lead">We are still looking for people to help with the event. Please <a class="page-scroll" href="#contact">contact us</a> if you are interested. </p>

We are passionately committed to being able to cover our speakers' costs and ensure that the conference is free to attend. By crowd funding, we can hopefully raise the money we need through donations, and those who cannot spare much, or indeed anything, will still be able to come.</p>
